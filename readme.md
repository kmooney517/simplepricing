This is my Simple Pricing project. Same concept as the skinny ties, but easier.

Description:

The task was to create an HTML page simply from an image file. I took an image file and turned it into a website with HTML and CSS. I was practicing with common HTML tags and CSS layout strategies. Objectives

Tools I used included: Normalize CSS, Google Fonts, HTML, CSS, Sip, and PerfectPixel
